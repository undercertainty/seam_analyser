       "      <td>TM351 was a unique module, in my opinion. TMAs assessed practical skills and iCMAs assessed theory skills. I question why other modules dont follow suit because it was fascinating doing that. Then again, maybe other modules cannot always use practical programs like Jupyter Notebooks.But assessing in this way stretched my knowledge of using Python as well as a broad range of theory-based content too: DBMS, Mongo, legal and ethical considerations, semantic data, linked data - I was astonished at how much was packed in, and the ability to be assessed on both Python and theory too.The content was detailed. Much more than I would ever have considered in October 2020. Wow.Also, my tutor spoke to me in a really lovely way. I didnt feel I was \"just another student\", rather, I felt like a person that they genuinely cared about. Hes a great gent, thank you!</td>\n",
       "      <td>TM351 is a genuinely incredible module, theres no two ways about that.However, there is no way on this Earth that this is a 30 credit module! Theres a lot to the module, sure, but I studied a 60 credit module in 2020-21 as well, and it ended up being bit-part to TM351.The mountain of printed academic investigations for that module was eclipsed by the entire print outs of only the week-to-week print outs of TM351. Come the end of the year, my TM351 folder is 3 times larger than my 60 credit one, and that includes the print outs and aforementioned further academic material in it. The time spent on TM351 was much longer than the 60 credit one too. Sure, a lot is assessed in this module, though the studying and assessment time was simply, probably double that, of my 60 credit module.I loved studying TM351, genuinely, but the time I spent studying this module definitely didnt befit 30 credits.There were multiple upsides to this module, and one of them is the value of the module - in terms of content, this was by far and away the most well-informing module Ive studied with the OU.My tutor was genuinely amazing, I felt at ease with them so quickly. I feel like I can add value to an organisation with the study from this module too. The final investigation was overwhelming by the amount of data available and as a dyslexic, I struggled with understanding and taking in so much at one time, especially with the EMA looming. However, the flexibility of investigating your own question was brilliant, and whereas my EMA questions probably werent the most exciting, the freedom to study something using skills learned on this module gave me great pride. TM351 has given me a lot of accomplishment, and I relished the opportunity to study the module. Thank you!</td>\n",

       "3  TM351 was a unique module, in my opinion. TMAs assessed practical skills and iCMAs assessed theory skills. I question why other modules dont follow suit because it was fascinating doing that. Then again, maybe other modules cannot always use practical programs like Jupyter Notebooks.But assessing in this way stretched my knowledge of using Python as well as a broad range of theory-based content too: DBMS, Mongo, legal and ethical considerations, semantic data, linked data - I was astonished at how much was packed in, and the ability to be assessed on both Python and theory too.The content was detailed. Much more than I would ever have considered in October 2020. Wow.Also, my tutor spoke to me in a really lovely way. I didnt feel I was \"just another student\", rather, I felt like a person that they genuinely cared about. Hes a great gent, thank you!   \n",

       "3  TM351 is a genuinely incredible module, theres no two ways about that.However, there is no way on this Earth that this is a 30 credit module! Theres a lot to the module, sure, but I studied a 60 credit module in 2020-21 as well, and it ended up being bit-part to TM351.The mountain of printed academic investigations for that module was eclipsed by the entire print outs of only the week-to-week print outs of TM351. Come the end of the year, my TM351 folder is 3 times larger than my 60 credit one, and that includes the print outs and aforementioned further academic material in it. The time spent on TM351 was much longer than the 60 credit one too. Sure, a lot is assessed in this module, though the studying and assessment time was simply, probably double that, of my 60 credit module.I loved studying TM351, genuinely, but the time I spent studying this module definitely didnt befit 30 credits.There were multiple upsides to this module, and one of them is the value of the module - in terms of content, this was by far and away the most well-informing module Ive studied with the OU.My tutor was genuinely amazing, I felt at ease with them so quickly. I feel like I can add value to an organisation with the study from this module too. The final investigation was overwhelming by the amount of data available and as a dyslexic, I struggled with understanding and taking in so much at one time, especially with the EMA looming. However, the flexibility of investigating your own question was brilliant, and whereas my EMA questions probably werent the most exciting, the freedom to study something using skills learned on this module gave me great pride. TM351 has given me a lot of accomplishment, and I relished the opportunity to study the module. Thank you!  \n",

       "      <td>TM351 is a genuinely incredible module, theres no two ways about that.However, there is no way on this Earth that this is a 30 credit module! Theres a lot to the module, sure, but I studied a 60 credit module in 2020-21 as well, and it ended up being bit-part to TM351.The mountain of printed academic investigations for that module was eclipsed by the entire print outs of only the week-to-week print outs of TM351. Come the end of the year, my TM351 folder is 3 times larger than my 60 credit one, and that includes the print outs and aforementioned further academic material in it. The time spent on TM351 was much longer than the 60 credit one too. Sure, a lot is assessed in this module, though the studying and assessment time was simply, probably double that, of my 60 credit module.I loved studying TM351, genuinely, but the time I spent studying this module definitely didnt befit 30 credits.There were multiple upsides to this module, and one of them is the value of the module - in terms of content, this was by far and away the most well-informing module Ive studied with the OU.My tutor was genuinely amazing, I felt at ease with them so quickly. I feel like I can add value to an organisation with the study from this module too. The final investigation was overwhelming by the amount of data available and as a dyslexic, I struggled with understanding and taking in so much at one time, especially with the EMA looming. However, the flexibility of investigating your own question was brilliant, and whereas my EMA questions probably werent the most exciting, the freedom to study something using skills learned on this module gave me great pride.

       "3   TM351 is a genuinely incredible module, theres no two ways about that.However, there is no way on this Earth that this is a 30 credit module! Theres a lot to the module, sure, but I studied a 60 credit module in 2020-21 as well, and it ended up being bit-part to TM351.The mountain of printed academic investigations for that module was eclipsed by the entire print outs of only the week-to-week print outs of TM351. Come the end of the year, my TM351 folder is 3 times larger than my 60 credit one, and that includes the print outs and aforementioned further academic material in it. The time spent on TM351 was much longer than the 60 credit one too. Sure, a lot is assessed in this module, though the studying and assessment time was simply, probably double that, of my 60 credit module.I loved studying TM351, genuinely, but the time I spent studying this module definitely didnt befit 30 credits.There were multiple upsides to this module, and one of them is the value of the module - in terms of content, this was by far and away the most well-informing module Ive studied with the OU.My tutor was genuinely amazing, I felt at ease with them so quickly. I feel like I can add value to an organisation with the study from this module too. The final investigation was overwhelming by the amount of data available and as a dyslexic, I struggled with understanding and taking in so much at one time, especially with the EMA looming. However, the flexibility of investigating your own question was brilliant, and whereas my EMA questions probably werent the most exciting, the freedom to study something using skills learned on this module gave me great pride. TM351 has given me a lot of accomplishment, and I relished the opportunity to study the module. Thank you!  \n",
