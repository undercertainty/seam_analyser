# seam_analyser

To plot the results of one or two of the seam spreadsheets.

To run, you'll need Jupyter notebooks running ipython. Easiest way to install, if you don't want to do everything from scratch, is to use Anaconda ( https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/ ).

Use <code>Student feedback plots.ipynb</code> for a single spreadsheet, or <code>Comparison plots.ipynb</code> to compare spreadsheets from different presentations.

The included spreadsheets have randomised data.
