# seam_analyser

To plot the results of a seam spreadsheet.

To run, you'll need Jupyter notebooks running ipython. Easiest way to install, if you don't want to do everything from scratch, is to use Anaconda ( https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/ ). May also need seaborn (I don't use anaconda, so I don't know what comes as standard), and may need to update your excel reader: if so, the trace will tell you what package needs using.

Use <code>Student feedback plots.ipynb</code> for a single spreadsheet, and change the filename in the early cell to point to your spreadsheet. Then run all cells.
